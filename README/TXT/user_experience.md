## Strategy Plane

At the strategy level, wordUpp aims to make a small mark on text-based visual content creation for social media. The primary goal is to empower users to create captivating word art effortlessly, ensuring their content stands out and resonates with their audience.


### Target Audience

- mainly the Social media users that post.
- Any other case in which a user might need word art with this style

### Market Research

- Noticing that there is a type of post on social media that is just text; it comes in the format of an image because of attention.
- I didn't find any app with the possibility of grid and repetition. I of course, took Photoshop out of the equation and thought that a simple tool for a specific style would have its place.

### User Goals

- User will achieve a specific type of content. base on word, or word + image, or word + image + effects.
- the user can compose and download their own creations after registration 
	- free (0.00, limit 10 per month)
	- premium (0.99 Unlimited)
- users get to combine their own style with grid-based word art.
- Users that want word art without thinking of the ugly word art from the 90s.

### Bussiness Goals

- The main goal is to carve a specific new style in the global social media zeitgeist.
- That comes with a very low premium price for maintenance and little profit.
