## Strategy Plane

At the strategy level, wordUpp aims to make a small mark on text-based visual content creation for social media. The primary goal is to empower users to create captivating word art effortlessly, ensuring their content stands out and resonates with their audience.


### Target Audience

- mainly the Social media users that post.
- Any other case in which a user might need word art with this style

### Market Research

- Noticing that there is a type of post on social media that is just text; it comes in the format of an image because of attention.
- I didn't find any app with the possibility of grid and repetition. I, of course, took Photoshop out of the equation and thought that a simple tool for a specific style would have its place.

### User Goals

- User will achieve a specific type of content. base on word, or word + image, or word + image + effects.
- the user can compose and download their creations after registration 
	- free (0.00, limit 10 per month)
	- premium (0.99 Unlimited)
- users get to combine their style with grid-based word art.
- Users that want word art without thinking of the ugly word art from the 90s.

### Bussiness Goals

- The main goal is to carve a specific new style in the global social media zeitgeist.
- That comes with a premium price for maintenance and little profit.

## Surface Plane

On the surface, wordUpp showcases a modern and sleek design. With a harmonious blend of colours, typography, and visual elements, the application ensures that every interaction is functional and aesthetically pleasing, echoing the essence of creating stunning textual imagery.


### Color Scheme

The design tries to assert itself as a strong-edge electric bubble gum, a massive contrast with solid colours, with three different accent colours that complement it. 
The background is soft to complement the black-and-white solid contrast of the text. 

<img src="../IMG/design/design-01.jpg" width="80%">

### Typography

Two fonts, One strong with a lot of weight and the other with a condensed width for buttons and other UI controls.

I chose a good range of fonts from Google font for the canvas. Enough to give various choices and moods to achieve any look and feel.

<img src="../IMG/design/design-02.jpg" width="80%">

### Imagery and Icons

For the youthful look, I populated the website with chunky icons all over, when possible, with accent and black colours contrasting with an accent colour. 

<img src="../IMG/design/design-03.jpg" width="80%">

### Micro-interactions 

I made a few animations to raise interest, especially on the homepage. 

* features sections:

<img src="../IMG/animations/features.gif" width="80%">

* hero section:
