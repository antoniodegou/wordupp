# Tests

## Validation

### HTML Validation

On the HTML validation, there were no errors.

There were warnings, but they were all related to Bootstrap 5 and how they designed their components. In this instance, the validator pointed out elements inside a 'p' or button tag without text.

another warning had to do with the tag that Bootstrap gave me the CDN; some fields seem not to be liked by the validator.

### CSS Validation

No errors were found on the CSS validator.

### JavaScript Linting

No errors were shown in the JS validator. there were a lot of warnings about using the ES6. For example, a warning for me using LET/CONST instead of VAR

### Python Linting

No errors were found on PEP8 on my Flask app.


### Accessibility

I got no error on the grounds of accessibility

But the performance and Accessibility are higher in most pages 100.

## Bugs

* Once the user registers, sometimes they get redirected to the dashboard already logged in, and sometimes they get not logged in and have to log in again. I couldn't find out what makes this unpredictable behaviour.

* Colour picker works differently in Firefox, so it only updates the canvas once you click off the picker. It doesn't produce any errors, just a less smooth user experience. 

* Fonts don't seem to load well on Safari; I have seen this issue online but couldn't find a way to make it work for my project.
